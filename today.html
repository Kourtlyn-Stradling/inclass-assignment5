            <h1>Bunyip</h1>
            <h2>First Discovered in 1818</h2>
            <p>The Bunyip, also known as the Kianpraty, is a creature from Aboriginal mythology in southeastern Australia. 
               It is said to live in swamps, billabongs, creeks, riverbeds and waterholes. 
               The word Bunyip translates to "devil" or "evil spirit" in the Wemba-Wemba language.</p>
            <p>Physical descriptions of the Bunyip vary. Some say it has a dog-like face, dark fur, a horse-like tail, 
               flippers, walrus-like tusks, a crocodile-like head and a duck-like bill. There are even claims that it 
               resembles a snake with a beard. While its wide range of descriptions make it difficult to determine its 
               appearance, <strong>it is agreed that the Bunyip is aquatic.</strong></p>
